### What is this repository for? ###

This is a set of programs to simulate large-footprint full-waveform lidar from airborne lidar and to process it and perform various other tasks. The parts are:


**gediRat**: simulates GEDI waveforms from ALS .las files and outputs ASCII or HDF5 waveforms.

**gediMetric**: processes full-waveform data (LVIS or simulated GEDI) and outputs metrics.

**mapLidar**: produces geotiffs from .las files of different properties. Also produces the bounding boxes of .las files for use in overlapLasFiles.csh.

**lasPoints**: outputs .pts files from .las files for selected areas.

**lvisBullseye**: produces the correlation bullseye plots of ALS to full-waveform data following Blair and Hofton (1999).

**addNoiseHDF**: Reads waveform data from HDF5 files and adds noise of a chosen level.


To find options, type the above command with "-help". These are explained in full detail later. 


There are some C and bash shells to control the above:

**gediRatList.csh**: batch processes gediRat.

**filtForR.csh**: converts the output .txt files into .csv files for reading in to R.

**overlapLasFiles.cs**h: determines which .las files are needed for a given simulation.

**orbitTracks.bash**: produces lists of footprints from GEDI orbital simulations.

**listALS.csh**: produces the lists of .las files needed to read multiple files.

The other .c files are either small test programs in the development of the above or are libraries called by the above. Important libraries are:

**gediIO.c**: contains the GEDI simulator functions.

### How do I get set up? ###

Clone the repository and point to its location with the environment variable:

    GEDIRAT_ROOT


All programs depend on these libraries:

* Gnu Scientific Library
* Geotiff
* HDF5
* GDAL

Minpack (Levenberg-Maruqardt):  https://www.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/cmpfit.html


Point to these with the environment variable:

    GSL_ROOT
    HDF5_LIB
    CMPFIT_ROOT

Once they're installed, it also requires two libraries without package managers:

[**C-tools**](https://bitbucket.org/StevenHancock/tools)

[**libClidar**](https://bitbucket.org/StevenHancock/libclidar)

Clone these from bitbucket and point to their locations with the environment variables:

    HANCOCKTOOLS_ROOT
    LIBCLIDAR_ROOT

To compile, type:

  **make THIS=gediRat**

Make sure that ~/bin/$ARCH exists and is in the path, where $ARCH is the result of `uname -m`.

  **make THIS=gediRat install**

Replace "**gediRat**" with each of the commands above to compile and install.


Make sure that all **.csh** and **.bash** files are also in your path.

##### Signal processing description


##### Gaussian fitting
Used for "gHeight", "rhGauss" and "gaussHalfCov". The waveform is denoised (mean+5*sigma, noise tracking to avoid truncation), smoothed (pSigma*0.75) and Gaussians fitted with Levenberg-Marquardt optimisation. The center of the lowest Gaussian containing at least 0.5% of the waveform energy is selected as the ground.

##### Maximum
Used for "maxGround", "rhMax" and "maxHalfCov". The waveform is denoised (mean+5*sigma, noise tracking to avoid truncation), smoothed (pSigma*0.75). The lowest maximum is taken as the ground.

##### Inflection points
Used for "inflGround", "rhInfl" and "inflHalfCov". The waveform is denoised (mean+5*sigma, noise tracking to avoid truncation), smoothed (pSigma*0.75). The centre of gravity between the lowest two inflection points is taken as the ground.

##### Half covers
Used for "gaussHalfCov", "maxHalfCov" and "inflHalfCov". Sum energy beneath estimated ground position. Double that is the ground energy. Calculate canopy cover, correcting for rho_v and rho_g.

cover=Ecan/(Ecan+Eg*rho_v/rho_g)

Where Ecan is the canopy energy, Eg is the ground energy, rho_v is the vegetation reflectance and rho_g is the ground reflectance.


##### Edge extents
